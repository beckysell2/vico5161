    <h1>What is Gestalt?</h1>
        <p>The German word "gestalt" can be translated into meaning "whole" or "form." Originating in the 1920s, it is a form of psychology that looks at the human mind and behaviors as a whole. Founded by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgan Kohler and Kurt Koffka, gestalt includes a set of organizing principles known as Gestalt Laws.</p>

    <h2>What does Gestalt mean to design?</h2>
        <p>As humans look at the world around them, our mind attemps to organize the information we see, linking components together and seeing shapes and objects. It is specifically Gestalt Psychologies work in visual perception that applies to design.</p>
    
        <p>The theory behind gestalt works into ten main principles that play into how this organization happens. For any designer, these play closely into how we organize and communicate.</p>

    <h3>Pragnanz, or Good Figure</h3>
        <p>People will organize elements into the simplest pattern.</p>
    
    <h3>Figure/Ground</h3>
        <p>People perceive shapes as either the part in focus (the figure) or the background (the ground).</p>
    
    <h3>Similarity</h3>
        <p>Visual elements that are similar, such as shape, size and color, are perceived as related.</p>
    
    <h3>Closure</h3>
        <p>When looking at a complex arrangement, we tend to look for one recognizable pattern.</p>
    
    <h3>Symmetry</h3>
        <p>We see objects as symmetrical shapes that form around a center point.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Fate</h3>
        <p>Elements that change at the same time, or in the same direction, are seen as a group.</p>
    
    <h3>Proximity</h3>
        <p>Items that are close together are seen as a group.</p>
    
    <h3>Good Continuation</h3>
        <p>Items that form a straight line are seen as a group.</p>
    
    <h3>Law of Past Experience</h3>
        <p>At times, people see visual perceptions and organize based on past experience.</p>
